# About Me

Iâ€™m a theoretical astrophysicist and mathematician at the University of Utah. My research is shared between the Department of Physics and Astronomy, where I study galaxy cluster dynamics and gravitational theory; and the School of Dentistry, where I work on mathematical models of trade-mediated pathogens in complex global trade networks.
